## Vishaal Vasu 
###### 2nd Year Computer Engineer at UC San Diego

### Summary
As a self-directed, hardworking Computer Engineering student, I have collaboratively completed advanced _projects_ involving data structures, _tutored_ undergraduates on _electronics_, and applied my knowledge in real-life scenarios through _clubs_ and _business ventures_.

Academically and as a hobby, I love exploring the interface between hardware and software and want to use my skills to **change the world in a meaningful way**.

I live by Nelson Mandela's words:
> It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.
